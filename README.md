# GLUE-ENERGY-7000
Prototype and documentation for Glue Energy: wireless, always-on energy system for devices, vehicles, and infrastructure.
# Glue Energy

## Overview
Glue Energy is a conceptual wireless energy system designed to provide continuous power to devices, vehicles, and infrastructure without traditional recharging. It also enables always-on internet connectivity.

## Vision
- Africa-first deployment, scalable globally
- Wireless energy hubs (Mini Glue Hubs) powering QUINOS devices, J-GLUE vehicles, and infrastructure
- Prototype focuses on documentation, design, and simulation for investors and partners

## Features
- Continuous wireless energy
- Scalable mini hubs
- Device & vehicle integration
- Flowless internet

## Prototype Status
- Currently conceptual; no physical devices built yet
- All designs, diagrams, and simulation plans are documented
- Next steps: lab simulation, hardware prototyping, pilot testing
